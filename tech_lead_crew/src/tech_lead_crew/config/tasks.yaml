analyze_and_extract:
  description: >
    Analyze the provided Jira issue and extract requirements to create an implementation specification.
    
  expected_output: >
    A combined issue summary and requirements extraction with the fields listed above, with no additional tool calls beyond the single jira_get_issue invocation. 
    
    CRITICAL VALIDATION: 
    - The "Title" field MUST be tool response["summary"] copied EXACTLY (character-for-character)
    - The "Description" field MUST be tool response["description"] copied EXACTLY (character-for-character)
    - If you wrote a title that doesn't match tool response["summary"], your output is WRONG - fix it
    - Do NOT infer titles from repository structure - ONLY use tool response data
    - The tool response is the SOURCE OF TRUTH - ignore everything else when writing title/description
